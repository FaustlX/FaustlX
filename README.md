- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FaustlX
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in C++ and Web Development with JavaScript and HTML/CSS. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all of the above and I'm a student, second year in university in Bulgaria, gotta admit that I don't know how things really go around in the programming world.
  Because I've not worked in real jobs yet, but I'm open to get low-end or just learning jobs, nothing big really. Open for invitations.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me, you can freely email me on this email adress northern.windvlll@gmail.com
